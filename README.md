# Task-15-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using the Breast Cancer dataset.

*Steps:*
- Data loading and preprocessing
- ColumnTransformer for scaling
- Pipeline creation
- Model training (Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Model saved as .pkl file

*Tools Used:*
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

*Conclusion:*
End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline using Breast Cancer Dataset.
Includes preprocessing with ColumnTransformer, Pipeline model,
evaluation metrics, and saved .pkl model.
